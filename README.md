# Age-detection-from-images

# Description:
Age detection from images aims to estimate a personâ€™s age based on facial features. In this project, we use a pre-trained deep learning model to predict the approximate age group from a face image. This is often used in demographics analysis, targeted advertising, or access control systems.

# ðŸ‘¶ðŸ§“ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Detects faces using OpenCV's DNN face detector

* Estimates age using a pre-trained CNN model (Caffe)

* Works on single or multiple faces in an image
